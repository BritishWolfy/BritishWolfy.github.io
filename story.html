									<p>442 412 is a member of the British Rail Class 442 fleet, known in the Southern Region as the 5WES. These units were introduced in 1988 by Network SouthEast on the South West Main Line from London Waterloo to Weymouth to coincide with the electrification of the line from Bournemouth. The class holds the world speed record for a third-rail train, having attained 109 mph (175 km/h) on a test run before entering service.</p>

									<p>This specific unit is numbered 442 412 and was operated on both Network SouthEast and South West Trains before being withdrawn in 2007. It was then reintroduced on Gatwick Express and once again withdrawn and placed into storage in Eastleigh in March 2020. It has been there ever since and is one of the few units that South Western Railway did not refurbish.</p>
										
									<p>The current status of the original buffet car (number 62947) is unknown and may require a conversion from another unit.</p>
										
									<p>The Wessex Electrics Preservation Group is dedicated to restoring 442 412 to its original condition, as it was with Network SouthEast in the 1990s. It will then hopefully be used on railtours, attached to a diesel locomotive on unelectrified sections of the line.</p>
										
									<p>All funds will be put into the restoration of the unit. The current status of the original buffet car (number 62947) is unknown and may require a conversion from another type of carriage. The original name "Special Olympics" will be returned to it.</p>
